# 35-marks-questions
This repository contains a number of questions for trainees with their solutions. Some of the codes will not be having their question or test cases in comments, so what you can do is, copy the code and paste it in any AI model giving the prompt to frame the question and test cases for it. Also, doesn't matter if you are a python or java trainee, questions would be similar for all.
